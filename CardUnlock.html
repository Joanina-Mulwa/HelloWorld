	<body style="background-color: grey;">
<h><strong>what is the use of a card unlock?</strong></h>
<p>A card unlock is used as a key in different intitutions to open doors, give access to certain rooms and also can be used for elevator purposes. it can be of great use in different institutions since it reduces chances of theft since the cards cannot be relaced or taken a copy of the same kind as it applies for the key itself. This is a project that i figured out to advance the key cards used in our day to day life to better keycards.</p>
<h><em>What are the advantages of a key card over a key?</em></h>
<ol>
	<li>It reduces theft cases;<br />a key card cannot be photocopied where as a key can be photocopied hence many people can have access to a certain place illegally.</li>
	<li>Easy recovery when lost;<br />For the key card, it can be easily tracked when lost unless a key when lost chances of recovering it are very low.</li>
	<li>Integrity issues;<br />The key card can be tracked and its easy to follow up where a certain person has gone and any rooms it has given access to</li>
</ol>
<h><em>What are the disadvantages of a key card</em></h>
<ul>
	<li>High chances of data leak;<br />the keycard can be hacked and this can lead to data leak</li>
	<li>Should not come into contact with a phone<br />This deactivates the keycard and this makes it hard to be placed near a phone since it deactivates it.</li>
</ul><hr />
<h>The project</h><br />
What drove me to decide to do this project?<br />I once went to Panari Hotel where i encountered this problem. I found it hard since at times i placed the keycard near the phone and it got deactivated. i preferred to put the keycard near the phone other than scattering in different places but how its made disadvantaged this. i decided to fix this problem and had to come up with a solution of advancing the keycard so that there are no specific places it should be placed.<br />For example, one can be late for a meeting and incase a keycard deactivates and cant access neither the door or the elevator, one can miss such a chance.<br />this problem oughts to be cubbed since the younger can keep the keycards away from the phones but the aged are disadvantaged. this population for the aged is what i took into consideration.
